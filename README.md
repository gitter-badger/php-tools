"Les README.md, c'est pas pour les Dahus." Julien Rosa

Thank you Julien to point the fact that I didn't write my readme file. So now on, i'll write it.

#DESCRIPTION#

The purpose of this project is to create an easy way to manage multiple languages on a php application (website, anything else)


###how to install it###

first you need to declare two classes which implements TranslatorConfigItf and LanguageItf (you can use example_includes.php and it will show you how to use it)
after that, you should define a short function (as my t() function in my example_includes.php)
That's it.

Just be sure the folder you specified is writable.
